> Angular and SpringBoot both have way too much of magic, if you are one who like to be in controll of their code, then you are in right place :)
> hope you find this project helpfull for you learning purpose.

In this project, Im going to build a Spring Boot Rest Api project that supports Token based Authentication with JWT and angular 9 . Youâ€™ll know:

  - Appropriate Flow for User Signup & User Login with JWT Authentication.
  - Spring Boot Application Architecture with Spring Security.
  - How to configure Spring Security to work with JWT.
  - Way to use Spring Data JPA to interact with PostgreSQL.
  - How to use genircs class repository and service.
  - How to organize and structure your work environment and folders (like in companies).

## About
This is an RESTfull implementation of an Mini Project Management System, using
spring boot rest pai as beck-end and angular as front-end.
The goal of the project is to 
- Highlight techniques of making and securing a REST full app using [SpringBoot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot)
- How to consume an RESTfull service and make an HTML5 based Single Page App using [Angular 9+](https://github.com/angular/angular)
- How to use an admin template [AdminLte 2](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE/releases/tag/v2.4.18) and intgrated with Angular

### Features of the Project
* Backend
  * Token Based Security (using Spring security).
  * API documentation and Live Try-out links with Swagger .
  * PostgreSQL DataBase Configuration.
  * Using JPA to talk to relational database.
  * How to request and respond for paginated data .

* Frontend
  * Organizing Components, Modules, Services, Directives, Pages , routing etc in an Angular App.
  * How to chain RxJS Observables.
  * Techniques to Lazy load Data.
  * Techniques to load large data set in a data-table but still keeping DOM footprint less.
  * Routing and guarding pages that needs authentication.
  * Basic visulaization.
  * Pagination with jquery integred in Admin template.

* Build
  * How to build all in one app that includes (database, sample data, RESTfull API, Auto generated API Docs, frontend and security).
  
### Build Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to PROJECT_FOLDER/webui (should contain package.json )
npm install
# build the project (this will put the files under dist folder)
ng build --prod --aot=true
# to strat
ng server 
# Or
npm start
```

### Build Backend (SpringBoot Java)
